SHORT DESCRIPTION
    psPAS is a PowerShell interface for the CyberArk REST Web Services.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    psPAS communicates with a CyberArk Privileged Access Security Web Service to submit requests and receive data.
    It send commands to the Web Service, enabling a user to issue create, list, modify, and delete commands to be
    executed against entities in a Privileged Access Security solution from either a PowerShell console or script.

EXAMPLES
    To utilise psPAS, you must have access to a CyberArk Privileged Access Security Web Service and a user account
    that can be used to log in to the Web Service.

    Which module functions, or in some use cases, which parameters or parametersets of particular functions, can
    be used, depends on the version of the CyberArk Web Service. The compatibility of each module commandÂ with
    each CyberArk version is shown in the following table:

    It is required to authenticate with the Web Service before issuing any commands. After successful authentication,
    the authorization token is acquired and used for any subsequent requests to the Web Service.

    LOGON:

    PS C:\> New-PASSession -Credential $VaultCredentials -BaseURI https://PVWA_URL

    All subsequent calls to the API will have access to the necessary authorization token value following a successful
    authentication with New-PASSession.

    PIPELINE OPERATIONS:

    All functions of the module accept pipeline input, allowing chains of commands to be created.

        Find and update a user:

        PS C:\> Get-PASAccount pete | Set-PASAccount -Address 10.10.10.10 -UserName pspete

        Activate a Suspended CyberArk User:

        PS C:\> Get-PASUser PebKac | Unblock-PASUser -Suspended $false

        Add a User to a group:

        PS C:\> Get-PASUser -UserName User | Add-PASGroupMember Group
