psPAS offers over 200 PowerShell commands for interacting with the CyberArk REST API. Originally launched on GitHub in 2017, the module is now also available via the PowerShell Gallery for easy installation and updates.

Designed for flexibility, psPAS supports both the latest CyberArk releases and legacy API versions, making it a powerful tool for automating everything from day-to-day admin tasks to complex operational workflows.

With full compatibility across Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core, the module enables cross-platform automation on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The module's standard set of commands offers a number of advantages for dealing with the CyberArk API, including:

- A shared development framework: 
  - Code that works for one user will function for others, or can be easily adapted to do so.
- Simple collaboration on common issues.
  - Gives users the opportunity to support members of the CyberArk community who are seeking to automate changes.

## Getting Help & Support

Because psPAS is a community-developed product, it is not covered by any current maintenance contracts you might have for CyberArk support. Likewise, since psPAS has been independently developed, you should not use the official support channels for assistance relating to the module.

Help and support should be sought by opening an Issue on the project's GitHub page (preferable), or emailing <a href="mailto:pspas@pspete.dev">pspas@pspete.dev</a> if opening a GiHub Issue is not an available option.

Priority support could be considered for sponsors of <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/pspete">@pspete on GitHub</a>. Contact us to discuss options.
