Initially released in 2017, psPAS contains over 100 commands for the CyberArk REST API.

The module is designed to be compatible with CyberArk from Version 9 onwards, providing CyberArk users with an accessible resource for automating simple day to day administration tasks as well as more complex requirements.

The module can work in both PowerShell Core & Windows PowerShell, meaning Windows, Linux, and macOS CyberArk automation is possible.

Using a shared set of commands for interacting with the CyberArk API provides many benefits:

- A shared development framework:
  - Code which works for one user will work, or can easily be adapted for others.
- Easily collaborate on shared problems.
  - Fosters an opportunity for developers to support others in the CyberArk community seeking to make improvements through automation.
