## **6.3.78**

### Added
- N/A

### Updated
- `Get-PASPSMRecording`
  - In-line with PVWA default operation:
    - Changed the default limit for each page of results to 100, in-line with PVWA default values
    - Updated to return recordings from the last 48 hours by default when `FromTime` & `ToTime` parameters are not specified.
